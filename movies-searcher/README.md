Questions:
1 - Should I use React.FC<Props> to type components or should I type them as a normal function?
2 - How should I improve the code to take the most advantage possible of Next.JS?
3 - I'm using TS correctly?
4 - How should I do this (if (page === null) params.set(SEARCH_PARAMS.PAGE, '1')) when the page isn't defined in the params? (search page)
